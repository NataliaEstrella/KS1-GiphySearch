# KS1-GiphySearch
 ProjectKS1 is a simple Gif search app. To search for gifs, simply type in a word into the searchbar, press enter and voil√†, Gifs! 
 For this project I used Swift's **Codable** protocol to map the data and **SDWebImage** for seamlessly displaying gifs. 

## How to run the app
This app contains cocoapods: Once you have downloaded the project, navigate to the directory containing the project and run "pod install". Dont forget to open the project using the .xcworkspace file. 


### Given more time I would:
    - Update the size of the cells to match the data provided by the JSON. 
    - Allow searching with multiple words. 
    - Allow the user to 3D Touch into a larger gif.
